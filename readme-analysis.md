# How Does the Analysis Work?

The analysis process is designed to explore and quantify the prominence of various aspects related to job postings within the Computer Science industry, such as job roles, job modes, programming language, technology framework and many more. To achieve this, the code conducts keyword analysis for each job posting page, systematically examining the presence of specific keywords associated with these attributes. For example, in the context of job roles, a set of keywords is defined for each job role, and if any of these keywords are found on a job posting page, it's considered as a mention of that job role. The accumulation of these mentions is done across a sample of web-crawled pages, enabling the determination of the relative popularity of different job roles and other categories. After each analysis, the result file is updated using a mutex to prevent data race, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the collected data. This approach provides valuable insights into which job attributes are most frequently mentioned in job postings, helping to identify trends and patterns in the Computer Science job market.
