# How Does the Visualization/Dashboard Work?

The visualization process is implemented such as to visualize the data achieved from analysis of the html pages acquired through web crawling. It reads through the analysis.json file which contain aggregate data as the result of keyword analysis and it produces bar and pie charts utilizing the streamlit and matplotlib library. To achieve the purpose of ease of understanding, categories with less than 9 values will be visualized in the form of pie charts. Categories with 9 or more values will be visualized by bar charts, only taking the 9 highest values and the rest categorically grouped as others. As the proportion of size of each category is different, the quantification of each values in a category is done on percentage of that value size relative to its category. This visualization process is done to better visualization of the data and to help improve the clarity of the report.
